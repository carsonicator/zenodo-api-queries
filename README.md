These are introductory exercises for accessing the Zenodo API using Python.

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an interdisciplinary open research data repository service built on the [Invenio](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/framework/) large-scale repository framework by the [European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)](https://home.cern/) and the [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/) organization. For more information, see [Zenodo's About page](https://about.zenodo.org/).
